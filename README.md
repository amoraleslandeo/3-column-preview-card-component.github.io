## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to force autoadjustment of the divs with this code:
```css
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

Also learned how to handle the responsive design:
```html
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

```css
@media (max-width: 375px) {
    main {
      height: auto;
    }
}
```

Also how to center the page vertically:
```css
html, body {
    height: 100%;
}
```
And how to center the content vertically:
```css
main {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    height: 100%;
}
```
